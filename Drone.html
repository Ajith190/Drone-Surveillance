	<h2>
		Introduction:
	</h2>
	<p>Drone surveillance enables surreptitiously gathering information about a target as captured from a distance or altitude. Drones’ flight capabilities, small size and ability to withstand harsh environments mean they can often survey subjects that might not be accessible otherwise and can access a first-person view (FPV) that would normally be impossible for the photographer.</p><div>
	<p>To hover, two of a drone’s four rotors move clockwise, while the other two move counterclockwise, ensuring that the sideways momentum of the drone remains balanced. To avoid throwing its vertical motion off-kilter, the other two rotors on the drone will increase their spin. The same principle applies to moving forward and backwards—the rotors of the drone must apply thrust while making sure the spin of the rotors keeps the drone balanced.</p></div>

		Working:
	</h2>
	<p>
A drone relies on rotors for its vertical motion. Drones use their rotors—which consist of a propeller attached to a motor—to hover, meaning the downward thrust of the drone is equal to the gravitational pull working against it; climb, when pilots increase the speed until the rotors produce an upward force greater than gravity; and descend, when pilots perform the opposite and decrease speed.</p><div>
